# my-events-list
This is a sample app in React native that lists events when user is logged in.

# How to run?
Assuming that you have Node 10+ installed, you will need to install the Expo CLI command line utility.
```
npm install -g expo-cli
```
Then go to this project folder, and run the following commands to install the app and link dependencies:
```
cd my-events-list
npm install
```
Now, make sure you have the Expo client app on your iOS or Android phone and connect to the same wireless network as your computer. On Android, use the Expo app to scan the QR code from your terminal to open your project. On iOS, follow on-screen instructions to get a link.

Finally:
```
npm start
```
